# foodie
This is a prototype web application project that the users can search for food they can cook by combining the (leftover) ingredients they have. The food can also be uploaded by the user if they have an account. That said, user registration system and recipe upload system, profile system, etc are also made.

This web application is made using xampp server with phpmyadmin as database. Database setting is required to have the web application working correctly.

Javascript is used as frontend langauge, and php is used as backend language.
