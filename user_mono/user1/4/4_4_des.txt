Easy dump-everything-into-the-pan recipe, mixed together with freshly cut lettuce and tomatoes and you're ready to go. It's a fantastic way to get your kids to eat fresh vegetables, even my anti-vegetable teenagers said it was great! If you want, add some hard boiled eggs. You can eat it with toast bread, pitas or rice, the world is your oyster...speaking of which....yum...lol
